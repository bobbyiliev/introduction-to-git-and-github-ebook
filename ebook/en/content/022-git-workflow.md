# Git Workflow

Now that you know the basic commands, let's put it all together and go through a basic Git workflow.

Usually, the workflow looks something like this:

A Big Picture

* First, you clone an existing project with the `git clone` command, or if you are starting a new project, you initialize it with the `git init` command.

* After that, before starting with your code changes, it's best to create a new Git branch where you would work on. You can do that with the `git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` command.

* Once you have your branch ready, you would start making the changes to your code.

* Then, once you are ready with the changes, you need to stage them with the `git add` command.

* Then, to commit/save the changes to your local Git repository, you need to run the `git commit` command and provide a descriptive commit message.

* To push your local changes to your remote GitHub project, you would use the `git push origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME` command

* Finally, once you've pushed your changes, you would need to submit a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch of the repository.

* It is considered good practice to add a couple of people as reviewers and ask them to review the changes.

* Finally, once the changes have been approved, the PR would get merged into the main branch taking all of your changes from your branch into the main branch.

The overall process will look like this:

My advice is to create a new repository and go over this process a few times until you feel completely comfortable with all of the commands.
