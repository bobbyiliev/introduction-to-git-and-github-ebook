# Introduction to Git

Welcome to this Git and GitHub basics training guide! In this **Git crash course**, you will learn the **basics of Git** so you can use Git to track your code changes and collaborate with other members of your team or open source maintainers.

Whether you are a newcomer to programming, or an experienced one, you have to know how to use Git. Most of the projects that a small or big group of developers work on are done through GitHub or GitLab.

It makes working with other developers so much more exciting and enjoyable, just by creating a new branch, adding all your brilliant ideas to the code that can help the project, committing it, and then pushing it to GitHub or GitLab. Then after the PR(pull request) has been opened, reviewed, and then merged, you can get back to your code and continue adding more awesome stuff. After pulling the changes from the main/master branch, of course.
