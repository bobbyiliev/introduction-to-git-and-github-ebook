# Create your GitHub profile

Apart from looking awesome, a good GitHub profile shows people what you can do and gives you a chance to show it off. Also job applications often include a section to add your GitHub profile link so this can be your chance to shine üí´

### Markdown

In order to create a GitHub profile you need to understand Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. Check out this
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images).

### Create a GitHub repository for your profile page

First of all you need to create a new repository. Use this link https://github.com/new to do so. You must name your repository the same as your GitHub username as shown below:

You will discover your secret/special repository! Make the repository public and select add a README file. Then you are done creating your repository. I recommend making your repository private whilst you work on it and then make it public once complete. Now time to add content and make it look awesome.

**Tip:** When working on a markdown file in your development environment, you can preview what the page will look like by pressing ```CMD+Shift+V``` or ```Ctrl+Shift+V```
 
### Adding a header

The first thing people on your profile notice is the header. Perhaps you could add a photo of something you love, your hobby, art that inspires you, an image of some code you worked on etc. You could even have your profile picture match it. I recommend an actual photo of yourself, rather than a cartoon. The markdown needed is:

```
![Repository Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/GITHUB-USERNAME/banner_photo.png)
```

Here is a website that allows you to generate header images for your GitHub profile READMEs. https://reheader.glitch.me/

### Introduce yourself
Say hello to your visitors. Write an introductory paragraph. Tell them a bit about yourself, where you are from, what inspires you. This section is where you can let your presonality shine though.

### Mention what you are up to
You can show visitors to your profile what you are up to and what you are working on. This is a great way for a them to get to know a bit more about you.
- üßê I'm interested in...
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...
- üå± I‚Äôm currently studying...
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to...
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with...
- üí¨ Ask me about...
- ‚ö° Fun fact:...

### Include statistics
You can display your GitHub stats on your profile. These include displaying total commits made, total pull requests, total issues etc. Check out these cool themes to display your statistics:

### Add social media buttons
Adding social meida buttons is a great way to direct visitors or even employers to you social media platforms. For example to add Twitter:

[![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/USER-NAME.svg?style=social&label=Twitter)](https://twitter.com/USER-NAME)
````
[![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/USER-NAME.svg?style=social&label=Twitter)](https://twitter.com/USER-NAME)
````

### Be creative
This is a fun project to work on. Be creative! There is a lot more you can add to your profile. From adding different statistics, technologies & tools you use, emoji GIFs etc. You can ask friends or other developers their opinions of your GitHub profile. Remember don't over do it. No one wants super fast animations or flashing images that will hurt their eyes. Think of nice color themes, what works well together and adding a nice profile pic. Good luck!
