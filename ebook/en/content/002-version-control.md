# Version Control

*Version control*, also called *Source control*, allows you to track and manage all of the changes to your code.

### Why Use Version Control?

* Multiple people could work on the same project simultaneously.
* Serves simultaneously as a repository, project narrative, communication medium, and team and product management tool.
* Records all changes in a log
* Allows team members to work concurrently and provides the facility to merge that work back together.
* Traces each change made to the software.
* Data is transitory and can be lost easily.

### What is Version Control System?

A tool that manages and tracks different versions of software or other content is referred
to generically as a version control system (VCS), a source code manager (SCM), or a
revision control system (RCS). With version control tools like Git, you can track all the changes to your code, and in case of any problems, you could easily revert to a working state of your source code. Like many of the most popular VCS systems available today, Git is free and open source.

With distributed version control systems like Git, you would have your source code stored on a remote repository like GitHub and also a local repository stored on your computer.

You will learn more about remote and local repositories in the next few chapters. Still, one of the main points for the moment is that your source code would be stored on a remote repository, so in case that something goes wrong with your laptop, you would not lose all of your changes, but they will be safely stored on GitHub.
